    <h1>Aditya Sadhu presents a Greek play by Sophocles</h1>
    <h2>PHILOCTETES</h2>
    <h3>THE PERSONS</h3>
    <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
        Yonder, above. And yet I hear no tread.<br>
    <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
        Look if he be not lodged in slumber there.</p>
    <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
        I find no inmate, but an empty room.</p>
    <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
        What? no provision for a dwelling-place?</p>
    <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
        A bed of leaves for some one harbouring here.</p>
    <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
        Nought else beneath the roof? Is all forlorn?</p>
    <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
        A cup of wood, some untaught craftsmanâ€™s skill,<br>
        And, close at hand, these embers of a fire.</p>
    <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
        That store is his. I read the token clear.</p>
    <p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
        Oh! and these festering rags give evidence,<br>
        Steeped as with dressing some malignant sore.</p>
